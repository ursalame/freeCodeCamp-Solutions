#Use the Twitchtv JSON API - [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/use-the-twitchtv-json-api)

1. Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/Myvqmo/.
2. Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
3. User Story: I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.
4. User Story: I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.
5. User Story: if a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.
6. User Story: I will see a placeholder notification if a streamer has closed their Twitch account (or the account never existed). You can verify this works by adding brunofin and comster404 to your array of Twitch streamers.
