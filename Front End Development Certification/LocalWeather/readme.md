#Show the Local Weather - [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/show-the-local-weather)

1. Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/bELRjV.
2. Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
3. User Story: I can see the weather in my current location.
4. User Story: I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.
5. User Story: I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
6. We recommend using the Open Weather API. This will require creating a free API key. Normally you want to avoid exposing API keys on CodePen, but we haven't been able to find a keyless API for weather.
